7/16/2024:
The schematic and PCB have been updated and will be kept up to date in this folder. 

Changes for schematic involve removals of all former peripheral chips due to space constraints, low energy budget, and generally low utilities. 

Changes for PCB include 10% smaller sizes, more efficient/shorter traces, and new chip placements.

Changed the SIM socket to a smaller one and fixed its direction

Add another PMOD plug and change both to SMD instead of through hole to allow for more space on the bottom side of PCB

Add more connection to the external MCU to allow usage of more types of MCU like ESP32s3 XIAO. 

Note: I've tried to explore some more external interfaces like a Mini PCIE on the side and M.2 slots. There are chances that I might try these ideas in the future. 
By the look of the direction of the project, I'm expecting the phone to be at least somewhat similar in performance to an iPhone 4G. The reason for this expectation
is due to both running the same CPU except the slower speed on my device.
