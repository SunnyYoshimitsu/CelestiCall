The schematic and PCB have been updated and will be kept up to date in this folder. 

Changes for schematic involve removals of all former peripheral chips due to space constraints, low energy budget, and generally low utilities. 

Changes for PCB include 10% smaller sizes, more efficient/shorter traces, and new chip placements.
